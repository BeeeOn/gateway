/**
 * @brief JournalQueuingStrategy implements persistent temporary storing of SensorData
 * into a filesystem structure. It controls contents of a selected directory. The contents
 * consists of buffer files and an index file (journal).
 *
 * The JournalQueuingStrategy maintains 3 kinds of files:
 *
 * - buffers - files named after their SHA-1 checksum (Git-like) containing serialized
 *   SensorData instances in a line-oriented way with CRC32 protection per-record
 *
 * - index - index of buffer files and byte offsets into them implemented as a journal
 *   (mostly append only file)
 *
 * - locks - when writing a file at once to disk (mostly buffers), a temporary lock
 *   files are created
 *
 * Writing data into the storage are controlled by the bytesLimit. If the limit is
 * reached by all persisted files (both active or dangling), the JournalQueuingStrategy
 * tries to garbage collect unused (dangling) files and if it does not succeed then
 * it drops also valid data that were not peeked yet.
