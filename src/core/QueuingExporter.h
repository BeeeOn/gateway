/**
* @class QueuingExporter
* @brief Implements Exporter interface and provides SensorData prevents
*        SensorData loss.
*
* QueuingExporter serves as interface for any particular exporter. It prevents
* SensorData loss by buffering them and cooperating with a QueuingStrategy. By
* inheritance of this class, the particular exporter can work with the data via
* acquire(), ack() and reset() methods.
*
* As long as this class implements the Exporter interface, it can be used with
* any particular class which implements the Distributor interface. Despite
* the particular Distributor could provide its own data buffering, it is not
* needed for any particular Exporter that inherits from QueuingExporter.
* QueuingExporter always reports successful export and provides both
* the persistent and via the QueuingStrategy also non-persistent buffering.
*
* QueuingExporter has its own buffer, which serves as a temporary SensorData
* backup. When a situation that could lead to significant loss of the data occurs,
* or when the data loss is probable, the data from buffer are pushed
* to the QueuingStrategy.
*
* - The data loss is considered probable when the particular exporter does not
*   report successful export by calling the method ack() for the time longer
*   than the set threshold
*
* - The possible data loss is considered significant when the buffer contains
*   more data than the set threshold.

	 * the QueuingStrategy are empty, given vector stays as given, else the data
	 * are added to the end of the vector.
	 *
	 * The count of the data to be required from the QueuingStrategy depends
	 * on the set backupPriority and the required data count. For example if
	 * the required data count is 10 and the backupPriority is 20%, 2 SensorData
	 * will be required from the QueuingStrategy.
	 *
	 * However, the result of this calculation could be a decimal number.
	 * In this case, the number is rounded down and the remainder is stored.
	 * The stored remainder is added to the result in the next call of this method.
	 * This eliminates the risk of unwanted suspension of the QueuingStrategy
	 * as the data source, as it is possible that the calculation result would
	 * always be less than 1.
	 *
	 * To avoid inconsistency in the case of calling this method multiple times
	 * without a successful export in between, two remainders are stored,
	 * one actual and one previous. If the successful export was not acknowledged
	 * since the last time this method was called the previous remainder is used
	 * in the calculation, to ensure that behaviour of the method will be equal
	 * to its last call.
	 *
	 * If the QueuingStrategy does not provide the required
	 * count of data, both remainders are reset to 0.
	 *
	 * The count of the data required from buffer is calculated as the difference
	 * of the required data count and the number of data loaded from strategy.
	 *
	 * A situation can also occur, when the sum of the SensorData in the buffer
	 * and the SensorData in the QueuingStrategy is greater than or equal to
	 * the required amount, but one of the sources has less data than is required
	 * from it based on its priority. In this case, all the data from that source
	 * are used to fill the vector, and the appropriate amount of data from another
	 * source is added, to provide the total required amount.
