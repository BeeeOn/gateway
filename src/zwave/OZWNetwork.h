/**
 * @brief OZWNetwork manages the Z-Wave network by using the OpenZWave library (OZW).
 * Its purpose is to handle OZW notifications and initiate OZW commands if needed.
 *
 * The OZW library has multiple configuration options. Some are set internally to
 * some sane values (unimportant for the BeeeOn gateway), others can be changed by
 * OZWNetwork properties.
 *
 * To initialize, the OZWNetwork::configure() is to be used. The method is called
 * automatically by DI. The deinitialization is implemented via OZWNetwork::cleanup()
 * (also called by DI).
 *
 * The OZWNetwork is able to handle multiple Z-Wave dongles (according to OZW). It
 * assigns dongles via the hotplug mechanism. It recognizes dongles with property
 * tty.BEEEON_DONGLE == "zwave". Currently, only dongles connected via tty are supported.
 *
 * Everytime when a Z-Wave dongle is detected via OZWNetwork::onAdd(), the OZW library
 * is notified and starts a thread for the driver. Drivers are removed on hot-unplug
 * via OZWNetwork::onRemove() or when the OZWNetwork::cleanup() is called.
 *
 * The OZWNetwork utilizes AsyncExecutor for performing asynchronous tasks that must
 * not be performed from the OZW notification handler function.
